            PrintWriter and has a method println() that uses the native newline character of whatever operating
            system you are on. So the \n can be excluded in the code. This has the advantage that you donâ€™t have to
            worry about adding those pesky newline characters. This could also be useful if you are generating text
            files on your own computer (and therefore OS) and will be consuming these files yourself.*/
